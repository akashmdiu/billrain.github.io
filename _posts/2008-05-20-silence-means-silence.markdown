Yesterday was the silence day, for the thousands of victims of Sichuan earthquake, considered as the largest nationhood event of our time. For a moment, the whole world fall into such great sadness and chaos, our motherland is crying and the people is suffering; for a minute, silence turns into holy condolences, everyone feels the serious memory within their body. For the first time, all the people are doing the right thing at the same time, and for the first time, people are facing the strength of silence, and the world should fear the power beneath the quiescence. The great nation must suffer from the great pain to be called great, to be united, to be immortal, and history will prove that, silence would mean something.
