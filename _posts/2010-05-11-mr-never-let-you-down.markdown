I was supposed to post this last week, but it’s proven that was not a good time. Mr. never let you down crashed down several online systems which may cause critical consequence. Indeed, it is not easy to avoid getting anybody down for all the times; and sometimes, work or life is really tough.

 

From my baby time I guess, to present age, some less than 30 years, I seldom act below expectation. Whatever as a child, as a student, as a newbie or as a professional, as a friend, as a team player, as a scorer, as a leader, a Virgo is supposed to rule his duty—that’s actually what I did. And I will faithfully continue to perform like that, as a husband, as a father, as a director, as a value distributor…in the future.

 

That is true what Shakespeare said, someone is born great, someone become great, and some are prompted to be great. For me, it is hard to tell. From my understanding is, one should born with some talent and, should believe in dreams and keep moving towards to it, also need someone to bring up or push you at exact moment.

 

“Best of me”is a good title for many rock songs, but “superman”isn’t. Even former could rule the world while individuals could only control their own, life is the result of your own activities. Even the outstanding people will encounter unexpected condition, that is something could make them really precious. Not everyone got the chance to save the world, also not everyone got the chance to destroy it. Life is meant to shine, even sometimes there will be a cloud, the radiance shall light up the world.

 

Working with machines, the funny thing is, for some instance, one system could be recovered within very short time, probably human cannot. Because the machine cannot learn, human can. Graduated from the so called West Point of mainframe, now I feel what’s battle field like, if you cannot hold on and fight back, people will die. The red line is expanding, victory or black and blue, let’s see.

 

Hello world, be confident, I won’t let you down.
