This is the day.

 

This is the day upon some years ago when I was born. And I have just lived through half of my whole life, living, with the dreams.

 

Those miracle dreams, real or unreal, touchable or untouchable, drama or tragedy, war or peace, human or butterfly, coincidence or setup, concatenated my life.

 

And this is the day.

 

This is the day I begun the second half of my life.

 

History was written, with people I loved and of thankfulness.

 

Shall I create the history, the history with being myself, with honor and dignity, with gods and demon, with sadness and truth, with human beings, with peace and love, with best of me, and you.

 

Also endless dreams, underneath the stars, shining, brilliantly.

 

This is the Brill day.
