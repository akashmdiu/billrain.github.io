DO you know what is the meaning of my title?

Well, usually I don't want to say that I am busy, but I'm really on a tight schedule, another week full time meeting, staying put in the small tiny room, keeping my eyes and brain focused, and again 1000+ unread feeds, even I have to think about my post while my walking home, uh...2nd but, my team with partner are really working on something special and unique, more than you can image, which would make us different. And this weekend comes the Olympic Games, hope everything could be fine then, especially the peace of my hometown.
