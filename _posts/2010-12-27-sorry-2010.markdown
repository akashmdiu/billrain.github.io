每个月都好像一个世纪般

于是十二个世纪里发生什么都不觉得意外

虽然有时觉得一年形影匆匆

但想想发生过的已刻上时间烙印的种种  
又显得有些漫长

_Those we have, we never need_

_Those we need, we never have_

_Just No one wants to be themselves these days._

[audio:Underneath the Stars.mp3]

What changed, may not

What remain, may changed

That’s the reason why we don’t really need to realize.

How shall I say Goodbye to year 2010?

Like a puppet or, a resister or, a follower?

Fortune un-told, story un-bet, and farewell un-signed?

It’s amazing chaos.

People forgive because they love

People strive because they dream

People achieve because they believe

Which I have them none.

I see you

I see you 

And I see you

The life cross me by

The life pass me by

And the life miss me by

Fear conquered, Blind listened, Lullaby expired.

_Long live the king, the old king is dead._

And blame, is to be punished(promised).

Acoustic, Melody and Departure 

Left no argue no choice and no excuse,

Sorry, 2000+10.
