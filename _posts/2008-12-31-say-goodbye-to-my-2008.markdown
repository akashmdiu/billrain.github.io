I wanna say goodbye to my 2k8

 

It was common but extraordinary

 

It was hope and failure

 

It was sad but ture

 

It was expected and unexpected

 

It was success and fair

 

It was growth and develop

 

It was think and think

 

It was said and done

 

It was astonishment and recover

 

It was selfish and given

 

It was love and peace…

 

So I shall remember what it takes and means

 

And I wanna thank my friends and colleagues

 

I always say it is amaing to work or study with the talented people

 

I can hardly bare the nonentity

 

Even though once I have said that

 

Sometimes it is the people you donot wanna be 

 

would make you become the people you wanna be

 

We should face and learn

 

and be grateful and faithful

 

Finally it is you make you become who you are

 

Thank you for being with me or without me

 

Thank you for coming to me or leaving me

 

Thank you for the good or the bad you have done to me

 

what I know or donot know

 

Thank you for visiting my blog and comment

 

I will appreciate

 

At last

 

2k9 is coming to us within one hour

 

Predictable it will be busy 

 

just starting from tomorrow

 

To say the truth

 

I am not of much expection

 

Almost everything is on the right way

 

what I need is just to take it over

 

being simple honest and going straight

 

So just wahch me 

 

as a deep blue ocean 

 

flow fly and cloud

 

Happy new year

 

That will be my 2009 

 

And yours

 

!
